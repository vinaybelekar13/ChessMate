// Naming WHY a move was bad, from the position alone -- never from the engine's
// choice of reply. Asking the engine "what would you play back?" is Brilliant

// hanging (the quiet h3 was called a sacrifice), and its reply is not stable
// between runs. So every motif here is decided by static exchange evaluation
// (seeGain) plus board geometry -- exact, and identical on every run. The
// engine's SCORE is still used, to know a mistake happened and whether mate is
// forced; its move is not.
